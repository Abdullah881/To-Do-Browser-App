# To Do List App 
This code appears to be a simple web application for managing a to-do list using HTML and JavaScript, with data storage in the browser's `localStorage`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `get_todos()` Function:
   - This function is used to retrieve the tasks from the browser's local storage.
   - It initializes an empty array `todos` to store the tasks.
   - It attempts to fetch the stored tasks as a JSON string from the local storage using `localStorage.getItem('todo')`.
   - If there are tasks stored (`todos_str` is not `null`), it parses the JSON string into an array and assigns it to `todos`.
   - Finally, it returns the `todos` array.

2. `add()` Function:
   - This function is called when the user wants to add a new task.
   - It gets the task text from an HTML input element with the ID 'task'.
   - It checks if the task is empty or just whitespace and returns `false` if it is.
   - It calls `get_todos()` to retrieve the current list of tasks.
   - It adds the new task to the `todos` array.
   - It updates the local storage by converting the `todos` array to a JSON string and saving it with the key 'todo'.
   - It clears the input field.
   - It calls the `show()` function to update the displayed list of tasks.
   - Finally, it returns `false` to prevent the default form submission behavior.

3. `show()` Function:
   - This function is responsible for displaying the tasks on the screen.
   - It calls `get_todos()` to retrieve the current list of tasks.
   - It initializes an HTML string (`html`) to create an unordered list (`<ul>`) for displaying the tasks.
   - It iterates through the `todos` array and generates list items (`<li>`) for each task along with a delete button.
   - It sets the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element with the ID 'todos' to the generated HTML, effectively updating the displayed list of tasks.
   - It also attaches a click event listener to each delete button so that the `remove()` function is called when a delete button is clicked.

4. `remove()` Function:
   - This function is called when a delete button (with the class 'remove') is clicked.
   - It retrieves the `id` attribute of the clicked button, which corresponds to the index of the task to be removed.
   - It retrieves the current list of tasks using `get_todos()`.
   - It removes the task at the specified index using `splice()` and updates the `temp` array.
   - It updates the local storage with the modified `temp` array.
   - It calls `show()` to refresh the displayed list of tasks.

5. Event Listeners:
   - The code sets up event listeners for:
     - Clicking the 'Add Item' button (`'add'` element) to call the `add()` function.
     - Calling the `show()` function initially to display any stored tasks when the page loads.
     - Clicking any delete button (`'remove'` class) to call the `remove()` function.

This code essentially creates a simple to-do list application that allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, and displays the tasks on the web page using HTML and JavaScript, with data persistence in the browser's local storage.
